### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Scientist and iOS developer.

Mobile Developer with a strong iOS expertise

I am a specialized iOS developer with training from the Apple Developer Academy at the Catholic University of BrasÃ­lia. My expertise spans the development of native and hybrid mobile applications, including React Native and Flutter.

Throughout my career, I have honed skills in backend development using Node.js and gained experience with DevOps, including CI/CD implementation, monitoring, and cloud integration. This multidisciplinary approach has given me a comprehensive understanding of the software lifecycle and the seamless integration of diverse platforms and technologies.

With an adaptable and collaborative mindset, I am driven by technological challenges and committed to delivering high-performance, scalable, and maintainable solutions. I actively pursue learning opportunities and leverage best development practices to tackle new challenges with excellence.
